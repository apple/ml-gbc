Please assess the image focusing on '{}'. Start by confirming its presence with 'Object Present: Yes' or 'Object Present: No'. If present, describe its key features in a detailed caption with at most 50 words. Then, evaluate if any aspects stand out for further emphasis, stating 'Prominent Features: Yes' or 'No' while preferring "Yes". If yes, list a few notable features in brackets, applying [single] or [multiple] as appropriate. Importantly, do not include '{}' in features. Instead, you should break it down.
